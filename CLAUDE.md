## Skills MCP Server

This project has a Skills MCP server connected. **Always check for relevant skills before starting tasks.**

### When to check skills:
- Building forms or validation → check `forms` skill
- Working with PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX → check those skills
- Creating React components → check `component-library` skill
- Building dashboards or charts → check `dashboard` skill
- Any complex or unfamiliar task → search skills with `search_skills`

### How to use:
1. Use `mcp__skills-server__search_skills` to find relevant skills
2. Use `mcp__skills-server__get_skill` to load the skill content
3. Follow the patterns and guidance from the loaded skill

### Available skill domains:
- forms (react, vue, vanilla, validation, accessibility, security)
- component-library (shadcn/ui patterns)
- dashboard (charts, real-time, filtering)
- pdf, docx, xlsx, pptx (document processing)
- building (3D game mechanics)
- mcp-builder (creating MCP servers)
- test-driven-development
- frontend-design

**Proactively load skills rather than relying on general knowledge.**
